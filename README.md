# Netflix Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Description
This project involves a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Netflix dataset using Python. The dataset contains information on Movies and TV Shows available on Netflix, including details such as title, director, cast, country of origin, release year, rating, duration, and genre. The primary goal of this analysis is to uncover insights into content trends, genre preferences, regional contributions, and overall growth patterns.

Using libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and WordCloud, the data was cleaned, visualized, and analyzed to extract meaningful insights. Various questions were addressed to understand the content distribution, growth trends, and correlations between features.

## Project Overview
This project involves performing an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Netflix dataset using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and WordCloud. The goal is to uncover insights about the growth, distribution, and trends in Netflix's content library.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Statistics
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- WordCloud

## Data Source
The dataset used for this analysis is publicly available and contains information about Netflix movies and TV shows.

## Project Steps
1. **Import Libraries**
    - Imported necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis.

2. **Load Data**
    - Loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame using `read_csv()`.

3. **Data Cleaning**
    - Checked for missing values and handled them using appropriate techniques (e.g., imputation, dropping).
    - Verified and corrected data types.
    - Identified and treated outliers using boxplots and statistical methods.

4. **Data Understanding**
    - Explored the basic structure of the dataset using `info()` and `describe()`.
    - Summarized the central tendency and dispersion of numerical features.
    - Analyzed categorical data using frequency distributions.

5. **Data Exploration and Visualization**
    - Created visualizations to explore the distribution of numerical features using histograms.
    - Visualized categorical features using bar charts, pie charts, and count plots.
    - Used boxplots to compare distributions across different categories.
    - Analyzed relationships between variables using scatter plots and correlation matrices.
    - Created heatmaps to identify correlations.
    - Generated word clouds for title and description analysis.

6. **Key Questions and Insights**
    - Analyzed growth trends of movies and TV shows over the years.
    - Explored the distribution of genres and identified popular ones.
    - Analyzed country-wise content contribution.
    - Investigated content duration patterns.
    - Examined content rating distribution.
    - Identified patterns in release years and content addition by months/quarters.
    - Explored frequent directors and actors, analyzing their genre preferences.
    - Analyzed genre co-occurrences and hybrid genres.
    - Investigated correlations between content duration, rating, and country of origin.

7. **Insights and Conclusion**
    - Summarized major findings from the analysis.
    - Discussed notable trends in content creation and audience preferences.
    - Suggested areas for further exploration or business recommendations.

## Results
- Clear visualizations illustrating the growth of content.
- Genre and country-wise content analysis.
- Insights into popular directors, actors, and frequent collaborations.
- Patterns in content rating and release timing.
- Correlation analysis between various attributes.
